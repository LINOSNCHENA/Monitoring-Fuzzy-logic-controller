# MODEL PREDICTION CONTROLLERS

The problem at hand is to solve a control problem by prediction the future of a dynamic system.  Three different types of models are used .  The following are the used model for our controllers; 
2. MATRIX computations model
1. CARIMA computations model
3. Diophantine equations model

## Current problems and tasks handled

Given that various obstacle would have different effects, we have identified two types of disturbances.  Formal and Uniform disturbance . These are the general categories of disturbances commonly inflicted. The effects simulated in MATLAB and performance of controller is observed. Comparisons for the computation based on the disturbance that is inflicted
1. A-E are using Matrix computational method
2. F-J are using CARIMA  computational method
3. K-O are using Diaphonies computational method

## Plots of results and observations

Various results were obtained. The following are the comparison criteria;
1. Without any disturbance
2. Uniform disturbance
3. Gaussian disturbance
